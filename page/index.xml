      <description>Hack MySQL Hack MySQL is my personal blog about MySQL, the Go programming language, and software design.
The content of this site is inspired by two things. First is my job at Square. Working with thousands of databases, hundreds of microservices, and engineers across the company, I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate to always have new challenges and opportunities to both learn and mentor. A lot of the posts and pages began as conversations with colleagues.</description>
