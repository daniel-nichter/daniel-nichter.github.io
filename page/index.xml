      <description>Hack MongoMySQL Hack MongoMySQL is my personal blog about databases, the Go programming language, and software design.
In 2017, I started hackmongo.com thinking that I would do more work with MongoDB—a new frontier for me—but in the last three years I have continued to work with MySQL. Moreover, in the five years since I stopped HackMySQL.com (2005-2015), I have seen an increasing gap between MySQL advancements and free, independent MySQL knowledge and tools.</description>

      <title>Percentiles</title>

      <description>Percentiles Percentiles are ubiquitous in application performance monitoring, particularly the 95th (P95), 99th (P99), and 99.9th (P999) percentiles. The basic concept is simple: percentile Pn means n% of all values are &amp;lt;= than the Pn value. If the P95 value = 100ms, then 95% of all values are &amp;lt;= 100ms. In other words: 5% of all values are &amp;gt; 100ms. Percentiles discard the top (100-n)% values as outliers for various reasons which are outside the scope of this page.</description>

      <title>Command-line Interface Antipatterns</title>

      <description>Command-line Interface Antipatterns Apps (web, mobile, and native) and APIs do not lessen the need or importance of command-line tools. A beautifully designed command-line user experience is arguably more important and than a graphical UX because the command line is deceptively simple: text on a screen. Wielding mere text on screen is an art akin to wielding mere paint on canvas. This page documents what I believe to be command-line interface (CLI) antipatterns which, in the long or short run, detract from both UX and developer effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Go Antipatterns</title>

      <description>Go Antipatterns These Go lang antipatterns are inspired by SQL Antipatterns. Antipattern Go code is syntactically correct, but there&amp;rsquo;s a better way that&amp;rsquo;s both functionally equivalent and idiomatic.
These are guidelines not absolutes. For example, Generic Package is common in practice and often difficult to avoid. Spending significant time trying to rename a util package can quickly amount to bikeshedding. Therefore, the antipatterns are divided into three classes: critical, important, and stylistic.</description>

      <description>Idiomatic Go Canon can·on /ˈkanən/ noun : a general law, rule, principle, or criterion by which something is judged
These texts explicitly and implicitly define idiomatic Go code. Read, memorize, and refer to them often. Use them to settle debates.
