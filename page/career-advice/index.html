<h3 id="1-add-value">1. Add Value</h3>
<p>Success follows value.</p>
<p>Ensure that the work you do <em>adds value</em> to the business and other people.</p>
<h3 id="2-write-well">2. Write Well</h3>
<p>When writing any document that&rsquo;s read by other people (even if it&rsquo;s just a README), always use proper grammar and style. Read <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/631739/grammatically-correct-by-anne-stilman/">Grammatically Correct</a> if you need to learn grammar, and read <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/198856/it-was-the-best-of-sentences-it-was-the-worst-of-sentences-by-june-casagrande/">It was the <em>best</em> of sentences, it was the <em>worst</em> of sentences</a> if you need to learn style.</p>
<p>Typically, no one will say (or perhaps even notice) when your writing is correct because it&rsquo;s presumed that professionals write professionally.
But others will notice poor grammar and style because it&rsquo;s tedious to read—you&rsquo;re making them do extra work to understand your words.</p>
<p>Being known or associated with poor writing won&rsquo;t hurt your career, but it certainly won&rsquo;t help it either.
On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re known for impeccable writing, that will help your career because clear writing adds value, and success follows value.</p>
<p>Avoid jargon, slang, idioms, and &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; writing because it&rsquo;s practically guaranteed that English is not the native language of many readers.
Also avoid these because, in tech specifically, they don&rsquo;t add technical clarity or value.</p>
<p>Every detail matters.
Don&rsquo;t use a punctuation mark unless you&rsquo;re reasonable sure that both grammatically and stylistically correct.
Don&rsquo;t make obvious or numerous spelling mistakes.
Don&rsquo;t leave wordy, unclear sentences: fix them.
The goal isn&rsquo;t perfection—every document will have little flaws—the goal is simply no obvious mistakes.</p>
<p>Like many things, good writing encourages good writing—it helps  maintain a high standard. When code, for example, becomes riddled with poorly written docs and comments, it certainly will <em>not</em> encourage other engineers to write properly. It&rsquo;s more likely to give other engineers an excuse to write poorly, too.</p>
<h3 id="3-hype-yourself">3. Hype Yourself</h3>
<p>Bragging, excessive pride, and self-promotion are typically rude, frowned upon.
But self-evaluations and promos are the one time I suggest and encourage you to do exactly that: brag, be proud, and most definitely be a self-promoter.
In the workplace, if you don&rsquo;t believe in yourself and your work, why should anyone else?
Sometimes good managers will see past some self-doubt and believe in an engineer before they&rsquo;re self-confident, but don&rsquo;t count on that.
Managers are looking out for their careers, too, so they tend to gravitate towards self-confident people because they seem like a safer bet (of course, sometimes people are &ldquo;all show&rdquo;, just talk and no real performance).</p>
<p>Never lie or overstate the facts for self-evaluations, promos, resumes, and job interviews, but make yourself and your accomplishments shine—be your biggest fan.</p>
