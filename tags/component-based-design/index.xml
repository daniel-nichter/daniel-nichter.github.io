      <description>Software systems are difficult to design because code does not delineate and organize itself. Even experienced engineers can struggle to design a system because there are many solutions but it&amp;rsquo;s not clear which is the best. Compounding the difficulty: engineers know that code can work fine even if, internally, it&amp;rsquo;s an unorganized highly-entangled mess. We want code to be well-organized, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to make it so. Component-based design is the solution.</description>
