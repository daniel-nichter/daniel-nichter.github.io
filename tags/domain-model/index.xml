      <description>Approaching a new software project is difficult for two reasons. First, there&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;ldquo;guiding star&amp;rdquo;, no objective starting point. The developer can begin from and proceed in many directions, which makes choosing difficult. They want to proceed in a good direction from the start, not wasting time or effort, but how can they make a good choice without a guide or the benefit of experience? Being forced to choose and move ahead, the choice is often made randomly rather than methodically.</description>
