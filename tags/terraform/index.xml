      <description>If you run MySQL on Amazon RDS and use passwords, I sure hope you frequently rotate those passwords (among many other security best practices). But if you don&amp;rsquo;t rotate them, I might know why: it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult to set up when you really get into it. It seems easy at first, but if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried you know how quickly it becomes complicated. At least, that was my experience. So to help others overcome the challenges and do frequent password rotation, I wrote up a long read: MySQL Password Rotation with AWS Secrets Manager and Lambda.</description>

      <description>MySQL Password Rotation with AWS Secrets Manager and Lambda MySQL password rotation using Amazon RDS for MySQL, AWS Secrets Manager, and AWS Lambda is a complex challenge to automate at scale. It appears easy at first—just two services and some IAM resources, right? But actual implementation quickly reveals a significant depth of considerations, choices, trade-offs, and technical problems. This page is a detailed guide to implementing MySQL 5.7 password rotation—fully automated at scale—using AWS RDS, Secrets Manager, and Lambda, and Terraform for cloud infrastructure.</description>
