      <description>Red Flag 1: More Than One close() When reviewing code that uses channels, first thing I do is search for close() on every channel. More than one close() is red flag because, unless all uses of the channel are carefully written and tested, it can lead to a panic on close of closed channel. It can also lead to strange behavior or subtle bugs because the code that didn&amp;rsquo;t close the channel isn&amp;rsquo;t aware the channel is closed, so send and receive on the closed channel don&amp;rsquo;t have the intended effect.</description>
