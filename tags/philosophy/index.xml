      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had several discussions with engineers, industry experts, and business people of various titles and functions (from sales to CEO) about the fate of a new open source database. It&amp;rsquo;s not MySQL, and I won&amp;rsquo;t name the real database because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter for the purpose of this post. But to make writing and communication more clear, let&amp;rsquo;s call the database &amp;ldquo;NewDB&amp;rdquo; and the business &amp;ldquo;New Corp.&amp;rdquo;
This blog post is a think piece on how New Corp.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 5 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://oreil.ly/efficient-mysql-performance&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Efficient MySQL Performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; addresses sharding, and it was difficult to write but not for technical reasons.
Let me say a little more on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is MySQL performance about &amp;ldquo;more&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;less&amp;rdquo;? From the title, you can tell that I&amp;rsquo;m going to argue that it&amp;rsquo;s about &amp;ldquo;less&amp;rdquo;. Here&amp;rsquo;s the punchline: zero is maximum performance. Let&amp;rsquo;s see where this philosophical blog post leads us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Other Tech Bubble is a provocative and interesting read. The author clearly has a lot of experience with Silicon Valley and has done their homework. There are many good insights, like &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re still asking if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to do something, and not whether they should.&amp;rdquo; But there are two claims and one ambiguity that need to be addressed.

      <description>The Senior Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Helping Others Make Decisions is a good read and good advice. I would summarize the advice as:
 &amp;ldquo;Seek first to understand, then to be understood&amp;rdquo; (Dr. Stephen Covey) Lead and guide, don&amp;rsquo;t micromanage Embrace change, which entails embracing other people&amp;rsquo;s thinking and way of doing things  In the first dialog, the senior engineer fails those three points.
